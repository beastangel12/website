        <pre>
            I found a love, for me
            Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
            Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
            Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
            <br>
            'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
            Not knowing what it was
            I will not give you up this time
            But darling, just kiss me slow
            Your heart is all I own
            And in your eyes, you're holding mine
            <br>
            Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
            With you between my arms
            Barefoot on the grass
            Listening to our favourite song
            When you said you looked a mess
            I whispered underneath my breath
            But you heard it
            Darling, you look perfect tonight
            <br>
            Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
            She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
            I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
            To carry love, to carry children of our own
            <br>
            We are still kids, but we're so in love
            Fighting against all odds
            I know we'll be alright this time
            Darling, just hold my hand
            Be my girl, I'll be your man
            I see my future in your eyes
            <br>
            Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
            With you between my arms
            Barefoot on the grass
            Listening to our favorite song
            When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
            I don't deserve this
            Darling, you look perfect tonight
            <br>
            Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
            With you between my arms
            Barefoot on the grass
            Listening to our favorite song
            I have faith in what I see
            Now I know I have met an angel in person
            And she looks perfect
            <br>
            I don't deserve this
            You look perfect tonight
